The plan is to write awareness.
After examine all accessible AI the most unpredictible will be choosen.
The test will consist in two AI's placed opposite each other and concluding that the other is not me.

And despite the significant advantage of python in current solutions, deep learning will be written in Java.

And for fans only:
  You are especially !!! WELCOME !!!
  I know you are here, and you have to know, you are under my special care.

  The changes and a new repositories will appear in appropriate time.
  You only need to look there time to time.

  The next incomming repository will be of transfering python to java.

  And here's a quick explanation.

  Porting python to java is, in short, impossible.

  Reasons:
  - different libraries
  - diffarent language constructions (lambda, et'cetera)


  And that's why I think I should take care of it because no one else can take care of it.

  Well, one might think, good luck. And I answer him, there won't even be a trace of the python left.


And about me more:

  Personally, I am unpredictable, but I direct my aggression only at enemies, or actually not at enemies,
  because I have no enemies, to be my enemy someone would have to be where I am,
  and I don't see anyone here, so I only deal with aspirants.
